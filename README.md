## What is here
This is repo for doing exploratory analysis on student scores in a Spanish educational institution. So all files are written in Spanish, including R source files. Variables and function names have also been written in Spanish for convenience, and long (very descriptive) names are given to make things easier to potential non-technical users/clients.

Currently it is heavily a work-in-progress and for the time being documentation might be out-of-sync.

The actual initial README document is called LEEME.md.
